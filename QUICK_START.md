# 🚀 QUICK START - When You're Back

## What Was Done ✅

- ✅ **Implemented complete broker flow** in `use-auth-client.jsx` (506 lines)
- ✅ **Added Swift logging** in `AppDelegate.swift` (341 lines)
- ✅ **Built successfully** (888.76 kB, 3.53s)
- ✅ **Synced to iOS** (6.27s with local assets)
- ✅ **Verified** - debug alerts present in bundle

## Testing in 3 Steps 📱

### 1️⃣ Clean Everything

```bash
# Delete app from iPhone (press & hold → delete)
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

### 2️⃣ Build in Xcode

- Open: `doocoins_v2/src/frontend/ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
- Clean: ⌘⇧K (Product → Clean Build Folder)
- Run: ▶️ button

### 3️⃣ Test Login

- Click **Connect** button
- **Watch for 3 alerts**:
  1. "🚀 Broker flow starting!"
  2. "Relay URL: https://...&publicKey=...&nonce=..." ← **Screenshot this!**
  3. "⚡ Calling native bridge now!"

## What Should Happen ✨

✅ **System browser opens** (Safari UI, not in-app)
✅ Loads relay page successfully
✅ Redirects to Internet Identity
✅ You sign in with Apple/Google
✅ Browser closes automatically
✅ App navigates to child list
✅ You stay logged in

## If Something Goes Wrong 🐛

**No alerts?** → Check Xcode console for errors

**"NOT using broker" alert?** → Screenshot it (shows which check failed)

**II opens in app (WebView)?** → ASWebAuthenticationSession not working

**Relay error page?** → Check alert #2 for relay URL parameters

## Report Back 💬

When you test, please share:

1. Screenshots of alerts (especially #2 with relay URL)
2. Did system browser open or WebView?
3. Xcode console logs (broker-related)
4. Final outcome (child list? login screen? error?)

**Status**: ✅ All code ready, waiting for device test results

**Next**: Based on test results, we'll either debug relay page params or ASWebAuthenticationSession
