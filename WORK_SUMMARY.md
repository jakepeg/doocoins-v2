# Broker Flow Implementation - Summary

## What Happened Before Your Break

You were seeing:

- ❌ "Missing required params: nonce, publicKey, or return" error on relay page
- ❌ No debug alerts appearing
- ❌ II opening inside the app (WebView) instead of system browser

**Root cause**: The broker flow source code was accidentally lost when I ran `git checkout` to restore a corrupted file. The app was using the OLD simple login flow without any broker logic.

## What I Did While You Were Away

### 1. Recreated Complete Broker Flow (use-auth-client.jsx)

✅ Added all imports: `Capacitor`, `Ed25519KeyIdentity`, `DelegationChain`, `set` from idb-keyval

✅ Implemented broker flow check:

- Detects iOS via `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`
- Checks broker flag (default ON for iOS)
- Waits for webkit.messageHandlers.broker availability
- Falls back to standard login if any check fails

✅ Session key generation:

- Creates Ed25519 key pair
- Extracts public key as DER hex
- Stores session key in localStorage

✅ Relay URL construction:

- Uses production URL when on capacitor:// origin
- Includes nonce, publicKey (hex), and return (doocoins://) parameters
- All properly URL-encoded

✅ Broker callback handling:

- Listens for 'broker:callback' event
- Parses code/nonce from URI fragment (hash)
- Fetches delegation chain from backend
- Reconstructs DelegationIdentity from chain + stored session key
- Persists to idb-keyval for AuthClient
- Sets identity and actor, marks login successful

✅ Retry logic:

- Generates NEW session key on retry
- Includes publicKey in retry relay URL
- Two retry paths (missing params, import failure)

✅ Debug alerts:

- "Broker flow starting!" - confirms broker starts
- Shows full relay URL - verify parameters present
- "Calling native bridge now!" - confirms webkit call
- "NOT using broker" - shows which condition failed
- Error alerts for failures

### 2. Added Swift Logging (AppDelegate.swift)

✅ Logs when broker message handler receives call
✅ Logs the relay URL being passed
✅ Logs ASWebAuthenticationSession creation and start

### 3. Built and Verified

✅ **Build successful**: 3.53s, bundle size 888.76 kB (up from 880.78 kB)
✅ **Sync successful**: 6.27s, copied to iOS with local assets
✅ **Verified**: All debug alerts present in synced bundle

## Current State

### What's Ready:

- ✅ Complete broker flow in source code
- ✅ Built and synced to iOS
- ✅ Debug alerts at every step
- ✅ Swift logging enabled
- ✅ All parameters (nonce, publicKey, return) included in relay URL

### What You Need to Do:

1. Delete app from iPhone
2. Clean build in Xcode
3. Build and run
4. Click Connect button
5. Watch for 3 debug alerts
6. See if ASWebAuthenticationSession opens (system browser)
7. Report back what happened

## Expected vs Previous Behavior

### Previous (Broken):

- No alerts
- II opened in WebView inside app
- Got "missing params" error on relay page

### Expected (Fixed):

- **Alert 1**: "Broker flow starting!"
- **Alert 2**: Full relay URL with all parameters
- **Alert 3**: "Calling native bridge now!"
- System browser (Safari UI) opens
- Relay page loads successfully
- Redirects to II, you sign in
- Browser closes, app navigates to child list

## Files Modified

```
/Users/Dev/Dev/doocoins_v2/src/frontend/use-auth-client.jsx
- Complete broker flow implementation (~350 lines added)

/Users/Dev/Dev/doocoins_v2/src/frontend/ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift
- Added NSLog statements for broker debugging

/Users/Dev/Dev/doocoins_v2/TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Comprehensive testing guide (created)
```

## Next Steps Depending on Results

### If ASWebAuthenticationSession Opens Successfully:

→ Great! Then we can debug why relay page still shows error (if it does)

### If Alerts Show But WebView Opens:

→ Swift bridge problem - ASWebAuthenticationSession.start() not working

### If "NOT using broker" Alert:

→ Check which condition failed (iOS detection, flag, or webkit)

### If No Alerts At All:

→ JavaScript not executing - check Xcode console for errors

**Status**: Ready for testing. All code implemented and synced.
